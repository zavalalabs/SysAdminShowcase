# SysAdminShowcase
This is my Personal Repository showing off finished code that is used for Systems Administration

## ðŸ“š Scripts Inventory

This repository contains various system administration scripts and tools. Below is an automatically generated inventory of available scripts:

### Shell Scripts

#### ðŸ”§ `appleDiskUtil.sh`

**Description:**
```
The goal of this script is to find the storage utilization of a macOS system. A common issue is that /Applications take up a huge amount of disk space
with that being said. User storage typically suffers as a result. So the real question comes down to "What's in the user's directory" and how does that influence the system selection for purchasing end user compute?
```

**Functions:**
- `check_home_directory_size()`
- `check_disk_space()`
- `log_data()`
- `Create Plist()`
